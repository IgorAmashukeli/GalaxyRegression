# Galaxy regression

1) Bachelor course work
2) Austronauts gave as data with galaxies
3) Our task was to estimate the masses of galaxies
4) While our t–µammate worked on clustering and finding more about specific relations in austronauts data,
we tried using
- Random forest
- XG boost
- Keras VariationalGaussianProcess model
- We used linear regression to find the best features
to estimate the masses of galaxies
